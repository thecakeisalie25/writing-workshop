your finger presses the keycap, friction fit to 
the stem which bounces up and down pushed up by
the spring which keeps the stem away from 
the actuator made of copper that connects the stem to
the wires which connect the sharp pins in the form of
a matrix of wires being polled every now and again by
the controller which translates outputs from the matrix into
keycodes which are numbers representing letters get translated to
binary ones and zeroes the pulses of electricity switching on and off across 
the cable which ends in a usb plug getting sent into 
the computer which translates keycode numbers into
letters which get put next to each other on 
the screen which shows you letters in the order you type to form
words which have a meaning all their own but are most effective in
sentences
or
paragraphs
or
phrases
or
insults born from
lies which form a
mockery out of them
but
you
still
hit
send.

nowhere in the keyboard from
the spring to
the actuator to
the matrix to
the controller to
the computer
is there anything 
that checks
your words
for morality.

but that's a good thing right? well
yes and no
to some 
the scammers
the conspiracy theorists
the hackers
the leakers
the little people
the ones who need a voice the most
and those who love free speech
is a resounding yes

and while I admit that free speech isn't
without it's problems
it is necessary.

but the problem isn't between the pcb and the pc
the real problem lies between the computer and the chair.

yes
we are the problem.
and there's no amount of solder that can fix it.
