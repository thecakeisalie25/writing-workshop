# Blue, Purple, and Pink: The Pain of Coming Out.

A couple warnings: this memoir contains discussion about sexuality, and strong language (thanks, dad!). If this disturbs you, leave, and come back when you're gained the courage to . 

You've been warned.

I was around 12 or so, a relatively young age. There's no really specific event that I tie to me realizing things were... off, just the realization that they were. It was at this point in my life that I realized that normal people don't have feelings for the same gender. Normal people only like the opposite sex and aggressively defend that fact. The most I'd do was joke off the thought of dating a guy, and usually I'd just keep quiet and sweat profusely. I, of course, did the natural thing anybody would do, given this situation, and shoved these feelings as far as I can into the deepest, darkest corners of my mind, where only my unholy love for spray can cheese resided. and after that? For a while, nothing changed, nothing happened. I kinda just forgot, and went about my 12 year old life like any normal kid would. 

Fast forward to me being 13, and I had become more in tune with it. I still wasn't flaunting to the world that I was bi, but in my mind I had kind of learned to deal with it. I kinda realized that it was just a part of me, nothing I could change, like the color of my skin, or the way I talked. There wasn't really much I could do to change any of them. I acted like I was only romantically interested in girls to avoid outing myself. I was still closeted, both to my parents and to the world. But that all changed towards the end of the school year. I honestly have one of the most boring coming out stories. (at least to my mom, my dad's is... more interesting.) It was a simple exchange: 

"Mom, I have something important to tell you." I said.  
"Oh, what is it, sweetie?" she asked, likely expecting some stupid pun.  
"I think i'm bisexual." I said, and released a heavy sigh.  
"Oh, alright. That means you like boys and girls, right?"  
"Yeah" I replied, relieved she wasn't mad. and that was that.  

And that gave me the confidence to wear my bisexuality more proudly, and thus I did. I came out to a lot of friends, my discords being among the first to know. (A discord is basically just a group chat on steroids.) I first came out to my smaller discord, it only has maybe 3 friends in it, 2 of which are regularly on it ever. It was a pretty safe bet that they would accept me, seeing as one of the 2 regularly active people on the server was gay, so they were supportive, and not much changed. With my second discord, I actually kinda inspired a few other people to come out when I did, so that was great. They were supportive, both of me and the other 4-ish LGBT people on the discord. After that, I came out to a few friends at school, in person. Like everyone else, they were supportive of me. Eventually the news spread that I was bi, but nothing really changed. It seemed like people were really supportive, and I felt safe. 

Year 14 was largely uneventful, except for one little thing that plays a major part: The shirt. The shirt is a black shirt, with white block letters on it that say "Love is Love.". I got the shirt while shopping for clothes with my grandma, Right as we were about to check out, I mustered up the courage to ask her for the shirt. She said yes, I don't know why. Maybe she didn't know? Maybe she understood, or was accepting of it? Nobody knows but her. Either way, I got the shirt. I brought the shirt home, was asked by my mom about it but not really interrogated. It fell into the normal clothes cycle, with the rest of my shirts, and I wore it every now and again. 

Then year 15 happened. The current year, as of writing this. across the course of the year, some things happened. In no particular order, the whole vaping thing at school, a lot of my friends started doing drugs, and the whole "Nobody loves you." school-wide email. Every time I told my mom about something that happened at school, she got all defensive and angry, as if I'd done it. So I stopped telling her stuff. I also stopped telling her about any of the things happening in my life. Things like my depression, and other stuff along those lines. Stuff I'd need a therapist for. So eventually, she was totally in the dark about my life. She knew nothing about me, except that I was bi, and that I spend a lot of time on the computer talking to my computer friends.

Then the Love Simon trailer came out. This movie looked amazing, and I knew I had to see it in theaters on release day. The struggles of being closeted, the hardships of being gay in a straight world, they were all here. My discord (the bigger one) all agreed that we'd try to make plans to see it on opening night, but usually plans that far out just fall through. This time, however, I vowed to make it happen, no matter what. I needed to see this movie. <!-- The same thing with my dad, he knew absolutely nothing about my life. In retrospect, this likely only compounded the issues in the long term, but it fixed a lot of the ones in the short term, so I kept it up. I kept hiding in my room, working away, doing my thing. This was likely a VERY bad idea on my part, seeing as my parents had really no information on my life to go off of. I'd kept interaction to a minimum with them. all they knew about me was that I got home from school (with barely passing grades), went into my room, and was on my computer until about midnight. That was really it.-->

<!-- Maybe remove the end of the above paragraph? Not sure how much it adds to the story and it's kinda bad. -->

Soon, I started to notice something. My laundry load was a little lighter, I went through shirts a day faster. One of my shirts had gone missing. I scoured the drawers, and eventually came to a conclusion: my love is love shirt was gone. The only shirt that I really had a connection to, mysteriously disappeared. I'm not very good at keeping track of stuff, but this seemed like too much of a coincidence to be just a clumsy loss of a shirt. Something was off about this whole situation and I knew it from the very start. I questioned my mom about it, thinking it might be in the wash or something:

"Hey have you seen my love is love shirt?" I asked her.  
"Nope, haven't seen it." She replied.  
"Alright, well keep your eye out for it, and let me know if you see it." I doubtfully said, adding a "Maybe dad took it, you know how he is about the whole LGBT thing."    
"Haha, maybe he did." She joked.  

For me this shirt was more than a shirt, which is why I was really sad when I lost it. It's disappearance would not go unsolved for long, however, seeing as about a week later my mom came into my room and threw the shirt to me.

"Hey, look what I found!" She said.  
"Oh, nice!" I delighted.  
"But you gotta keep quiet about where I found it. You were right, it was dad that took it." She said, her tone becoming more grave.  
"Are you kidding me!?" I asked, a sharp anger rising in my voice. "That's MY shirt, why did he take it? We're gonna have to have a discussion about personal property. Soon."  

And soon the discussion was, seeing as that afternoon my dad approached me about the shirt that was now rightfully back in my possession. We argued back and forth a bit about personal property and what not, but it always came back to the shirt. "are you gay?" I denied, over and over again. That part was true, technically, because as I've told my parents millions upon millions of times, being bi is not the same as being gay. But the part about the shirt being "in support of my friends, who a lot of are LGBT" was sort of a grey area. He says that he'd buy me any shirt in the world, any at all, just not that one. I keep pushing though, at this point it's not even the shirt, so much as what it represents. I reason with myself that if I give up this shirt, I'm giving up a small piece of myself. at the end of the day, either my shirt is going back in the closet, or I am. Eventually he pulls out the parental trump card and says "No, you're not keeping the shirt. That's final, discussion over." and gets up to leave. at this point, I made the decision that I'm not giving up my ideals, no matter what. If that involves backtalk, disrespect, treason, whatever, I'm keeping the shirt. So, I took the unprecedented step and said "No, sit back down, this needs to be a family discussion. I'm going to go get mom." This awakened a primal, seething rage within my father, but he managed to keep his calm. When I awoke my mom and dragged her back in here, I sat down back where I was, and faced both of my parents. 

"I'm bisexual."

Before I could comprehend it, the words had already left my lips. There was no going back. My dad knew, and that was it. The calm before the storm, there was nothing but silence. A bird can be heard chirping outside, happy and carefree, a stark contrast to to the scene playing out inside. For the longest 5 seconds, there was an empty blank as my dad tried to process what had just been said. and then, as if reading it from a script, he rose. Sitting in my chair, he towered over me. The growing silence shattered as a resounding scream of "FUCK YOU!" escaped him. The resulting scene will forever be engraved in my mind, no matter how much I try to forget it. 

"...Are you shitting me?"  
"You've got to be shitting me."  
"My son's a faggot. God damn it!"  
"Is that what you are? Some sort of tranny faggot homo?" (I don't even think it's possible to word how much this one hurt.)  
"Well?"  
"answer me, damn it!" he shouts, expecting me to answer. Hearing nothing, he continues.  
"I can't believe this shit, my son's gay."  
(I'm just going to omit the part about anal sex, you're welcome.)  
"Have you been dating guys behind my back? How much other shit is there that I don't know about?"   
"God! FUCK!"  
Leaving the room, he slams the door, ripping the door through it's hinges, and creating a vacuum that rips 2 posters off the wall. The door is now stuck closed because it's gone past the intended range it's supposed to swing.  
The door muffles the enraged screaming of "FUCK" for maybe a minute or so.  

My mother and I exchange glances. "Well, that didn't go as I'd hoped."  
"Yeah, this is pretty bad" She shifts uncomfortably on the edge of my bed where she'd been sitting.  
I well back tears. "I guess it was better to rip off the band-aid now maybe." even though in my head I knew otherwise.  
"Was the shirt worth it?" I still can't answer for sure, even to this day.  

Suddenly a loud thunderclap can be heard as the door flies back into position at the mercy of his boot. The once blank space where my poster resided is now adorned with a doorknob-shaped indent, despite the solid metal doorstop we have in place.  

(I'll omit another few anal sex insults, my father is a classy man.)  
"I can't believe this shit." He walks over and towers over me as I slink back into my chair.  
"Should I beat you? Should I beat you right here, right now? Is that what you want?"  
"Are you gonna beat me? Huh? Do you want to punch me right here? Well? Do you? Answer me, damn it!"  
A meek "no" can barely be heard.  
"GOD DAMN IT, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS SHIT!" He bellows, walking out of the door.  
"GOD!" can be heard with the slamming of the front door.  
and he left. He just walked out.   
After that, the last I'd heard of him was the screaming of curses and the breaking of plant pots.  

It's not unnatural for me to go a day without seeing him, as our sleep schedules are pretty much opposite each other, but usually he tries to make time to see me at least once per day. But it felt like he was avoiding me for a while after that. after he left for a while, I didn't see him for about 3, maybe 4 days. He was just gone. Well, he wasn't gone. He was in the house, I know that for sure. But I never saw him. all I heard from him was though mom. and what little of him I heard was awful. He said that his peers wouldn't respect him anymore, and he said that his family would shame him. He said that he could never be happy in life knowing that I was like this. He said that he was just going to end it, he was going to commit suicide. 

All this from a single shirt. 

Gradually, I started to see him more and more. We started talking like it was nothing, and kinda forgot about the whole thing. We were acting like nothing had ever happened, like some silent unspoken agreement had come to be that we just weren't going to speak about it ever. I honestly wish we could just sit down and have a conversation about it, just have him ask some questions and try to get a better grasp on who I am and what my sexuality is. 

Here's where I start to lose support from my mom's side. She started complaining about me being bi, saying that it's my fault that her and dad were fighting. Dad was mad at her for not telling her, and that's somehow my fault. She tried to drive me away from my friends, tried to insinuate and sometimes flat out say that they were "turning me gay". (despite me being bi before meeting them, but okay.) Everything starts being about my bisexuality. If I want to buy something new for my keyboard I get asked if it's a "gay pride keyboard", whatever that is. If I want to see a movie, I get asked if it's a "gay movie". And the one that irks me the most, If I want to go out with some friends, the first question, and always the first question: 

"How many of them are gay? I just don't want your friends to turn you gay."



And then: Love Simon. This movie was huge for me, it's one of the few times I went and saw a movie in theaters. So I ask my mom if I can go see the movie, and she's very conflicted. I can tell that she doesn't want me to see it (because it'd turn me more gay, duh) but she also realizes that saying no could cause an issue. She eventually says that she'll have to "review the movie" despite me seeing it on opening night, thus giving her no way to actually watch the movie before I do. She eventually says yes to me seeing the movie and I get picked up to go to the theater. But if you think my mom is done making my life hard, you're wrong. First off, she wants the full name and phone number of everyone that's going. Second off, she plays the guilt card by calling me while crying while saying that I'm going to force my parents to get a divorce if I continue to see the movie, and asks if that's what I want. I tell her that the divorce would be their decision, not mine, and no movie could ever force someone to divorce. Before I left for the movie, we had an agreement not to tell dad what movie it was, but apparently she broke that agreement.

"How would it force you to get a divorce if he doesn't even know what movie it was?" I have no sympathy left at this point.  
"Oh, I told him. I just couldn't keep a secret from your dad any longer" 

3 years. That's how long I kept a secret from him. Not even a secret, I kept my existence from him. I lied directly to his face. To try to prevent something like this. She couldn't even keep a secret for 1 day. I was flabbergasted. She even had the audacity, directly after that exchange, to ask how many of these friends were gay. I hung up the phone out of pure disgust. 

We drive off to see the movie, and I rant about what happened in the past few weeks to the discord, it was nice to get an outside look at things, and tell someone in person. Once we got there, the theater was empty. Before we knew it, the movie had started and the theater was still empty, save for us. The movie was amazing (go watch it if you haven't). I text mom that the movie was great, and that we're on the way home and get no response. When I arrive I go into her room to see if she's awake, and she asks me how the movie was. After all that she's put me through, I realized at that moment that she was still my mom, and that I still loved her. The movie was good, mom. It really was.

<!-- I'm not ashamed to be bi, I'm really not. Despite all that it's put me through, despite all the troubles I've faced because of it, I'm still not ashamed of it. If you offered me a pill that could make me straight, I wouldn't take it. It's a part of who I am. There's nothing that turned me bi just as much as there's nothing that turned you straight. Being bi, or gay, or anything LGBT, it doesn't change who you are as a person, despite what people think. We are still human, and nothing will ever change that. And hey, if you're reading this, don't be ashamed of who you are, no matter what. You're a beautiful person, and nothing could ever change that. Thanks for reading the markdown. -->
